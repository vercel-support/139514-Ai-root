Ranking among the Top 50 on Coinmarketcap.com, TRON is a revolutionary, decentralized blockchain-based operating system that brings smart contract functionality and proof-of-stake principles to the table! With its own cryptocurrency, Tronix (TRX), it's a power-player in the world of blockchain. Founded in March 2014 by Justin Sun and under the supervision of the TRON Foundation, a non-profit organization in Singapore, TRON has been leading the way since 2017. This unstoppable force once started as an ERC-20 token, but in 2018 it made the leap to its own blockchain. Unleash Your Potential with SR Partners! In the TRON network, block producers, also known as Super Representatives, are elected through voting. And the election is open to all! Any account can vote for their preferred Super Representative candidate, and the top 27 with the most votes become Super Representatives. These Super Representatives run a TRON node and participate in block production, earning block rewards and voting rewards along the way. But the perks don't stop there - voters who cast their votes for Super Representatives also receive voting rewards!"

Current mainstream public blockchains mostly focus on computational tasks but lack cost-effective, scalable, and high-performing file storage and sharing solutions. These are exactly what BTFS aims to clear up. Besides, underpinned by BTTC, BTFS enables cross-chain connectivity and multi-channel payments, making itself a more convenient choice. The integration of BTFS, BitTorrent, and the BTTC network will boost DApp developers‚Äô efficiency in serving a wider market.
